### Assignment: Voice Scheduling Agent (Deployed)

Please build a real-time voice assistant that:

- Initiates a conversation with the user

- Asks for their name, preferred date & time, and (optionally) a meeting title

- Confirms the final details

- Creates a real calendar event (Google Calendar or any other provider)

- Is deployed and accessible via a hosted URL or agent link

You may use any modern voice stack such as VAPI, Retell, Play.ai, ElevenLabs Realtime, Deepgram, OpenAI Realtime, or any other of your preference, along with any LLM.

### What to Submit:

- GitHub repository containing your code

- README including:

    - Deployed URL and instructions on how to test the agent

    - Optional: Instructions on how to run it locally

    - Explanation of your calendar integration

- Screenshots/logs or a short Loom video showing an event being created
